I have deployed it in streamlit and it predicts pretty well

It has an accuracy of over 0.6 in testing data set

Data set used in FERN dataset for emotion detection

Models which can be tried:
* EfficientNet
* YOLOv5
* ResNet
* AlexNet

This models where not tried due to time restrictions. Currently working on AlexNet, would push the model as soon as completed.

Accuracy/Loss vs Epoch during Training:
