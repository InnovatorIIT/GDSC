# About Problem Statement
We have been provided with a dataset on which we have to design a Machine Learning Algorithm which can perform sentiment analysis Accurately. The data provided was skewed in many sense, due to which intial accuracy of Machine Learning model is supposed to be of high bias and low variance. Hence the model works good enough only in training data, and tends to underfit on new data. The data provided was of about 2700
