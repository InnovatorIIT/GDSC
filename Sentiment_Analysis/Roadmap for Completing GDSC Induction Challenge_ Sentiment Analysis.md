Introduction

The GDSCInduction Challenge for Sentiment Analysis involved analyzing a dataset, preprocessing the data, using Google BERT,fine-tuning it to the provided data, training the model, and making predictions. This roadmap will outline the steps I took to successfully complete the challenge.

Step 1:Understanding the Data

The first step in any data analysis project is to understand the data. I carefully read through the dataset provided and familiarized myself with the features, such as the text data and sentiment labels. I also checked for any spelling mistakes and unwanted punctuations.

Step 2: Preprocessing the Data

After understanding the data, the next step was to preprocess it. This involved cleaning the text data by removing any unnecessary characters, converting all text to lowercase, removing stop words, and correcting spellings. I used TextBlob library to create very own spell checker module. I also performed tokenization and padding to prepare the data for input into the BERTmodel.

Step 3: Using Google BERT

Google BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a powerful language model that can be fine-tuned for various NLPtasks, including sentiment analysis. I used the pre-trained BERTmodel from the Hugging Face library and loaded it into my code.

Step 4: Fine-tuning BERT

To fine-tune BERTfor the sentiment analysis task, I first split the preprocessed data into training and validation sets. Then, I used the BERTmodel to extract features from the text data and fed it into a classification layer. I also used techniques such as dropout and batch normalization to prevent overfitting. I fine-tuned the model by adjusting the hyperparameters and monitoring the validation accuracy.

Step 6: Making Predictions

After training the model, I used it to make predictions on the test set. I fed the preprocessed test data into the model and obtained the predicted sentiment labels. I then compared these predictions with the actual labels to evaluate the performance of the model.

Conclusion

In conclusion, completing the GDSCInduction Challenge for Sentiment Analysis involved understanding the data, preprocessing it, using Google BERT,fine-tuning the model, training it, and making predictions. Byfollowing this roadmap, I was able to successfully complete the challenge and achieve accurate predictions.
